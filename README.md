| NACK/NAK     | Negative ACKnowledgement | disagree with the code changes/concept. Should be accompanied by an explanation | [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6100) |
| tested ACK         | Tested ACKnowledgment    |  reviewed the code changes and have verified the functionality or bug fix | [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6100) |
| utACK        | UnTested ACKnowledgment  |  reviewed and agree with the code changes but haven't actually tested them | [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6100) |
| Concept ACK         | Concept ACKnowledgement  | agree with the idea and overall direction, but haven't reviewed the code changes or tested them | [Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/6100) |
